3.1.0 (2013.01.07)

We're proudly releasing nGrinder 3.1 targeting the large organization. 
With some bug fix, the following improvements are for the effective operations of nGrinder.      

- Main features and change:
  * Support multiple region. User now can select one of multiple network regions to choose the agents depending on the test target location. 
    All controllers in regions need to use a directory on network file system for controllersâ€™ home directory.
    - See http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_ngrinder/entry/controller-clustering-guide
  * Share user accounts. Now a user can share his permission to other users. Then the other user can start/check test with his rights.
    - http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_ngrinder/entry/user-permission
  * Modified monitoring function to not to use DB to save monitor data. Now the monitor data will be saved in a data file of the test directory.
  * Enable the super user role. Super user can check all user's tests and scripts without the permission for system configuration.
  * Enhance the default process and thread count calculation.  process count is configured in the much better way.
    - See http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_ngrinder/entry/advanced-controller-configuration
  * Add dynamic system configuration. You don't need to restart the server for the most of configuration changes.
    - See http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_ngrinder/entry/advanced-controller-configuration
  * Make agent much stable by providing the appropriate memory size (Reducing OOM)
